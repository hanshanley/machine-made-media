## Machine Made Media Website Lists
GitHub repository for websites utilized to document the change in the rates of machine-generated/synthetic articles between January 1, 2022 and May 1, 2023.

We collected articles from these websites between January 1, 2022 and May 1, 2023. 

This dataset consists of 1,112 misinformation/unreliable news websites and 1,962 reliable/mainstream news websites. 

For additional details about the collection method and analysis of these websites' connection with other misinformation-related websites as well as more reliable mainstream news websites, see our paper/analysis here: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10880.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.09820.pdf).
